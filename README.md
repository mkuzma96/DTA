# Deconfounding Temporal Autoencoder

The following scripts are used to produce the results:

main.py      (main script containing the implementation code)

sim_exp.py   (reproducing the simulation experiments)

mimic_exp.py (reproducing the results with MIMIC-III)

The first two scripts are self contained. The last one uses the pre-processed MIMIC-III data set. The pre-processing pipeline is adopted from Wang et. al. (2020).
